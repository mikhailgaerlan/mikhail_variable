# Multiplex Simulation Code (Agent-Based Model)

This code is used to create the simulations we analyze in our paper. 
N.B. this code requires MASON to run: https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/

- To run: put all the java code in one folder and run with your favorite Java compiler. 
  We specifically use:

Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
Version: Neon.3 Release (4.6.3)

To generate simulation data: 

- In AgentsSimulation.java, go to: public static void main(String[] args)
- Add the appropriate parameters for the simulation
- At the top of the page: 
  - determine the number of timesteps with "lengthOfSimulations"
  - determine the number of times simulations are run with "numberOfSimulations"
  - Name the file with "datafilename"
- Run AgentsSimulation.java
